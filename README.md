### Hi, I'm Diego! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer from Paris, France.

Passionate about code, I develop both front and backend interfaces, mainly in React and NodeJS with a strong appetite for TypeScript. I love learning, understanding and testing.

Making the user experience as pleasant and fun as possible.
